            "value": "The image depicts two individuals walking along a beach, each carrying a surfboard. Specifically, there are two main people of interest in this scenario. The first person, situated slightly to the left and closer to the center of the scene, appears to be holding a surfboard under one arm. From their keypoints, this individual's body posture suggests they are mid-stride, with arms positioned to balance the surfboard's weight while walking. Their gaze and head positioning are slightly downward and forward, likely focused on the sandy terrain ahead.\n\nThe second individual is positioned more towards the right side of the image. Like the first person, they carry a surfboard under their arm. Their body posture, indicated by keypoints, reveals a similar mid-stride walking pattern with a slight lean, likely influenced by the surfboard's weight. \n\nThere are two notable surfboards in the image, one closer to the left and another to the right of the people. The surfboards' dimensions align well with being held close to these individuals' bodies, extending vertically with one end near the waist and the other protruding above head level.\n\nAdditionally, a beach umbrella can be seen in the background to the far right, suggesting a typical beach recreation setup. This umbrella, although not interacted with directly by the people in the foreground, provides context to the overall scene, emphasizing a relaxed, recreational beach environment. \n\nThe positioning and actions of the people, along with the surfboards and the umbrella, narrate a scene of beachgoers possibly heading towards or away from the water, ready for surfing or having just finished. The image exudes a relaxed yet active vibe, typical of a day spent near the waves. The presence of the beach umbrella suggests a prolonged stay, further indicating the scene's leisurely and recreational nature."

            "value": "The individuals depicted in the scene are likely participating in a game of pétanque or boules. This can be inferred from the distribution of the silver balls around a smaller red ball, which is characteristic of this sport. Pétanque is commonly played on sand or gravel, which matches the described setting.\n\nThe specific actions and roles of the individuals can be detailed as follows:\n\n1. **Central Participant**: One individual, who is centrally positioned and oriented towards the red ball, is likely taking a turn in the game. Their pose indicates that they are possibly aiming or about to throw a ball. Key points show concentration and a poised stance, implying readiness for action.\n\n2. **Observers/Teammates**: Several other individuals are standing around the play area, observing the game. Their relaxed and attentive postures, combined with sometimes folded or idle hands, suggest that they are waiting for their turn or watching the ongoing gameplay.\n\n3. **Interaction with Equipment**: Another person, positioned slightly to one side, is potentially acting as a referee or a player measuring the distances between the balls and the target ball. This can be deduced from their angled posture towards the balls and the proximity to the ground.\n\nGiven the nature of the game, where players must throw or roll their boules as close as possible to the target ball (the \"jack\" or \"cochonnet\"), the key actions involve precision, strategy, and periodic shifts in the players' positions around the play area."
